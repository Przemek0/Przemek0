## About me

## Programming
My first steps towards programming, I took when I was still in high school, and these were the basics of Pascal and C ++. I went to the University of Economics in Katowice to study, but unfortunately I could not finish them. During my studies, I managed to learn the basics of the C # language. After a few years, I decided to return to programming and explore the basics of the Java language under the supervision of mentors at the Software Development Academy, focusing on developing towards a Java developer.
I have always liked to solve problems and make repetitive tasks easier, I believe that programming as one of the tools will allow me and others to make our life more enjoyable.

## Course Software Development Academy
I had a pleasure to take a programming course in Software Development Academy
